# Jobify Frontend

One Vite + React + TS app; three surfaces under one HashRouter:

- `/` — applicant + public marketing (`src/sites/web`)
- `/employers` — recruiter marketing (`src/sites/employers`)
- `/console` — internal admin + recruiter ops (`src/sites/console`)

Shared transport/session/auth/env live in `src/shared`.

## Entry points

One app, one bootstrap: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `src/App.tsx` (a single
`<HashRouter>` that mounts each surface's route fragment). Routes are hash-based, so
every URL lives under `/#/`. Per surface:

| Surface | Dev entry URL | Route module | Mount root |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **web** (applicant + public marketing) | `http://localhost:5173/#/` | `src/sites/web/WebRoutes.tsx` | `/` |
| **employers** (recruiter marketing) | `http://localhost:5173/#/employers` | `src/sites/employers/EmployersRoutes.tsx` | `/employers` |
| **console** (internal admin + recruiter ops) | `http://localhost:5173/#/console/signin` | `src/sites/console/ConsoleRoutes.tsx` | `/console` |

- **web** is the root surface — `/`, `/explore`, `/applications`, `/inbox`, `/invites`, `/profile`, `/trust`, `/welcome`.
- **employers** — `/employers` (landing) and `/employers/verify`.
- **console** — entered at `/console/signin`; after sign-in, role-aware routing sends admins to `/console/admin/audit` and recruiters to `/console/recruiter`.

Each surface mounts its own `SessionProvider` (from `src/shared/session`) inside its
route fragment, so sessions are independent per surface. In production all three ship
in one static `dist/` served from a single origin — the surfaces are sibling route
subtrees, not separate builds.

## Run

    cd frontend
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, VITE_API_BASE_URL
    npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173

Live surfaces (web, console) need 5173 in the API's `JOBIFY_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`
and the dev origin in the Google Web OAuth client's Authorized JavaScript origins.

## Build / typecheck

    npm run build          # tsc -b && vite build → dist/

## CSS scoping

Each surface is wrapped in a `.surface-web`, `.surface-employers`, or `.surface-console`
class; per-surface CSS is scoped inside that selector to prevent cross-surface bleed.

## Design tokens

Each surface owns its own CSS-variable token system in `src/sites/<surface>/styles/`.
The static `frontend/styleguide/` is a hand-maintained snapshot of those tokens.
